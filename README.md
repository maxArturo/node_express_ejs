# Exploring Node.js
## About

This is a Node project, which I've been using to explore different server configurations, NPM packages, etc. These are the high-level steps I've taken thus far:

* started out with an implementation of the Express framework and EJS templating engine ([ref](https://www.thenewboston.com/videos.php?cat=355))
* integrated Grunt with a simple JSHint watch task to get started ([ref](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YFzYrllHkI))
* experimented with, and ultimately abandoned, Bower for managing frontend libraries ([ref](https://medium.com/@nickheiner/why-my-team-uses-npm-instead-of-bower-eecfe1b9afcb#.eui39e8vb))
* added Grunt/Browserify tasks to manage base and view specific NPM libraries for the frontend, including Bootstrap, jQuery, D3, Underscore and Moment ([ref](http://codeofrob.com/entries/grunt+browserify+npm+application=success.html))

## Generated by
* running `$ express --ejs node_express_ejs`

## Setup
* cd to node_express_ejs directory and run `$ npm install`

## Build
run `$ grunt`, which will build assets from the application folder into the public folder, in addition to kicking off a few watch events

## Server
* in a second console window, cd to tje node_express_ejs directory and run `$ npm start`
* navigate to `localhost:3000` in browser

## To do
* Live development server reloading
* Environment variables with Grunt uglify for prod (nconf)
* SASS
* React ([ref](https://blog.risingstack.com/the-react-way-getting-started-tutorial/))
* CRUD with a database (PG or Mongo, tbd)
* Tests (Jasmine with Jest)
* Staging server (Heroku probably)
* Production server build (Flightplan probably)
