#Learning Node
## About

This is a Node.js server, which I've been using to explore different configurations, NPM packages, etc. These are the high-level steps I've taken thus far:

* started out with an implementation of Express and EJS ([ref](https://www.thenewboston.com/videos.php?cat=355))
* integrated Grunt with a simple JSHint watch task to get started ([ref](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YFzYrllHkI))
* experimented with, and ultimately abandoned, Bower for managing frontend libraries ([ref](https://medium.com/@nickheiner/why-my-team-uses-npm-instead-of-bower-eecfe1b9afcb#.eui39e8vb))
* added Grunt/Browserify tasks to manage base and view specific NPM libraries for the frontend, including Bootstrap, jQuery, D3, Underscore and Moment ([ref](http://codeofrob.com/entries/grunt+browserify+npm+application=success.html))

## Generated by
* running `$ express --ejs node_express_ejs`

## Setup
* cd to node_express_ejs directory and run `$ npm install`

## Server
* cd to node_express_ejs directory and run `$ npm start`
* navigate to `localhost:3000` in browser

## Build
* in an second console window cd to node_express_ejs and run `$ grunt`, which will build assets from the application folder into the public folder, in addition to kicking off a few watch events (work in progress)

## To do
* Live development server reloading
* Environment variables (nconf)
* Expanded tasks (uglify, jscs, etc)
* SASS
* React
* CRUD
* Tests (Jasmine)
* Stage on Heroku
* Production server build (Flightplan probably)
