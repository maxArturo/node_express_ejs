## ABOUT
* started out with an implementation with Express and EJS [ref](https://www.thenewboston.com/videos.php?cat=355)
* integrated a simple JSHint Grunt task [ref](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YFzYrllHkI)
* integrated Browserify Grunt task to concatenate js files [ref](http://codeofrob.com/entries/grunt+browserify+npm+application=success.html)

## Generated by
* running `$ express --ejs node_express_ejs`

## Setup
* cd to node_express_ejs directory and run `$ npm install`

## Server
* cd to node_express_ejs directory and run `$ npm start`
* navigate to `localhost:3000` in browser

## Build
* in an second console window cd to node_express_ejs and run `$ grunt`, which will concat js files from the application folder and deposit them in the public/javascripts folder, in addition to kicking off a few watch events (work in progress)

## To do
* Environment variables
* Expanded tasks (uglify, jscs, etc)
* Libraries (eg jQuery, Bootstrap, Underscore, D3, etc.)
* SASS
* CRUD
